# Lab Animal Management Platform (LAMP)
Even now, the management of experimental animals in lab is still primitive and inefficient in ways from paper recording to Excel forms. These methods are hard to maintain and in short of sustainability. Different recording patterns from different researchers also make the transition painfully.

However, with the help of **LAMP**, the management of lab animals can be easy, fast and efficient. The versatility of **LAMP** make the research project progress stably and seamlessly.
